COVID-19 prevention with vaccination
============================================
A expert-driven, 'really rapid' living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/covid-19/

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* effective. However, the heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 88% before creating clinical subgroups.
